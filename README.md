## Fraction ##
Best solution if you are dealing with fraction. It is implemented over BigInteger. Minimum .Net Framework version is 4.0. 

----------

## Features ##

 1. Automatically simplifies fraction into its reduced form.
 2. Fraction can be represented in form of Mixed Fraction. Get or Set Fraction.WholeNumber or Fraction.ProperFraction property.
 3. Supports undefined values. Every undefined value is simplified as 0/0.
 4. Implemented over BigInteger can store all possible rational numbers.
 5. Convert fraction to string. Specify n digits after decimal point.
 6. Allows parsing from string to fraction e.g "1/33" , "-1.0003" etc
 7. Allows forced reduction of fraction by adding proper number to numerator or denominator. Use Fraction.Reduce() . A common example is reduction of 333333333333333/1000000000000000 is 1/3. [Note: User has to specify how much fraction is to be reduced.]
 8. Supports operations ,comparisons and conversion.
 9. Written in vb.net and c#.

## Upcoming Features ##

 1. Change in internal structure of fraction. (Fraction to be stored in form of mixed fraction to increase performance)
